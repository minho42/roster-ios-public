## Shutdown

The roster ios app has been removed from the app store. Thank you for using.

## FAQ.

#### Q: Why is it removed?

There has been significant consequences after I published the app which resulted me leaving the public hospital for good, therefore I no longer use it myself, and has no access to test the app properly from my device.

There's potential battle/headaches in the future against the authorities who didn't like what I did.

Therefore it's not really worth it for me to maintain the app unless I get monetary benefits, or become foolish again to fight against them for nothing.

#### Will it return?

Not for now, but there's some chance I may change my mind in the future. Making it under anonomous org is another option if there's a good reason for me to do so.

#### Will there be android version?

I have absolutely no plans to do so.

#### Can I make such an app myself with AI?

I made the app mostly using chatgpt but I made the web version previously and just ported it to ios.
I don't think it's easy but could be possible to make an app with AI if you know where to look for and what to ask to AI. But I advise you not to publish the app publicly under your real name, and not to tell everyone about what you did unless you're ready to retire or change career all together.
