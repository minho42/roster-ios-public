## Note

- This is an unofficial third-party app that improves the experience of HealthRoster users. Roster is still able to obtain your information because you logged in with your HealthRoster username and password.
- Your information is securely stored in the [Keychain](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_(software)>). There is no intermediary server between this app and HealthRoster.
- You can only see your own roster.
- Coworker names were not obtained without consent. This information is already present in the browser when you use the NSW HealthRoster. I simply made it more accessible.
- Being able to see who your coworkers are is one of your rights ([Know Your Rights by NSWNMA](https://www.nswnma.asn.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Know-Your-Rights-A5-book.pdf#page=12))
- Not all information accessible from HealthRoster is available in this app, e.g., notes, whether a shift has been changed after approval, etc.

If you can't log in, I'm afraid I can't fix it.
