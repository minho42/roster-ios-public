## Shutdown

The roster ios app has been removed from the app store. Thank you for using.

## FAQ.

#### Q: Why is it removed?

There has been significant consequences after I published the app which resulted me leaving the public hospital for good, therefore i no longer use it myself, and has no access to test the app properly from my device.

There's potential battle/headaches against the authorities who didn't like what I did.

Therefore it's not really worth it for me to maintain unless I get monetary benefits, or become foolish again to fight against them for nothing.

#### Will it return?

Not for now, but there's some chance I may change my mind in the future. Making it under anonomous org is another option if there's a good reason for me to do so.

#### Will there be android version

I have absolutely no plans to do so.
