## Shutdown

The roster ios app has been removed from the app store. Thank you for using.

### Why is it removed?

There were significant consequences after I released the app.
As a result, I no longer use the app myself and don't have the access to test it on my device.

There are also ongoing issues with authorities who weren't happy with what I did.

Therefore it's not worth it for me to maintain the app anymore.
