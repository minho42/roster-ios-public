# Privacy Policy

Roster is a third-party iOS app for NSW HealthRoster.
It does not modify HealthRoster data, and not all HealthRoster information is available in the app.

Your credentials and roster data are securely stored on your device, with no intermediary server.

If the official website changes, our app may not function properly.
We are not responsible for any resulting issues, inaccuracies, or disruptions.

We use Google AdMob for ads, which may collect data like device identifiers and IP addresses for analytics and targeting.
Aside from AdMob, we do not collect or share personal data.

This policy may change without notice.
